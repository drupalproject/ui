# ui
Reinvent UI layer for Drupal

# Introductions

This module want to create a simpler theme layer not so heavy.

# Features

* use different js & css stack in different theme in one site
* support multiple themes in same way
* new theme can use different theme engine
* so totally apply new rules in one site

# Why

I am in an old Drupal6 site many years with more than 400+ module enabled.
So it is very slow for rendering. This is a part of code to solve this issue.
